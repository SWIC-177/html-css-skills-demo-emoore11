      <h3>A little About Me</h3>

      <p>
        I was born and raised in the Midwest, but I do dream of having a
        disposable income that I can use to travel. That is, before climate
        change <em>really</em> decides to make us

      </p>

      <p>
        I care a lot about social issues, some would say <em>too much</em>.
        However, the topic of Human Rights is something I feel very strongly
        about.

        When I'm not spiraling from existential dread, I really enjoy hanging out with my pets, and my family. I love to be outside, reading, laying in my hammock. I've recently gotten into meditation, and that is something that I'm really beginning to enjoy. I have this delusion of picking up tennis as a hobby, but I've had an unused tennis racket and Wilson Sweatband for 3 years now.

      <h3>So.. Why Software Development?</h3>

      <p> I've been interested in Software Development for quite a while now. It was something that my grandfather did for work, and I have little memories of him doing some really cool stuff even on the older systems. So I'm excited to see how everything works for myself.</p>
